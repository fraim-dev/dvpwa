DVPWA -- Damn Vulnerable Python Web Application
===============================================

Description
===========

DVPWA was inspired by famous `dvwa`_ project and `bobby-tables xkcd comics`_.
The purpose of this project is to implement real-world like application in
Python with as many vulnerabilities as possible while having a good design and
intentions.

This project was used as demonstration of vulnerabilities during my
`Web vulnerabilities`_ presentation at EVO Summer Python Lab'17.

We have forked this project from [here](https://github.com/anxolerd/dvpwa).

In this repo, you will find many tests to compare Fraim against other traditional SAST companies as well as other AI tools.
